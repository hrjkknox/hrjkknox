- 👋 Hi, I’m @hrjkknox
- 👀 I’m interested in applications/backend development, as well as anything to do with CAN and radio communications (GM3TFT).
- 🌱 I’m currently a software engineering student at Heriot-Watt University.
- 💞️ I’m looking to find someone to form a startup with, ideally a very simple idea that can be built into a product (like google, snapchat etc.)
- 📫 You can find my contact details in my github bio, but I'm on twitter at [@terabyte_knox](https://twitter.com/terabyte_knox)
